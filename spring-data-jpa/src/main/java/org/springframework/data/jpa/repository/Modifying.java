 * applied on custom implementation methods or queries derived from the method name as they already have control over
 * the underlying data access APIs or specify if they are modifying by their name.

 * Queries that require a `@Modifying` annotation include {@code INSERT}, {@code UPDATE}, {@code DELETE}, and DDL
