 * Callback to rewrite a query and apply sorting and pagination settings that cannot be applied based on a regularly

 * The underlying the query is the one right before it is used for query object creation, so everything that Spring Data
 * and tools intends to do has been done. You can customize the query to apply final changes. Rewriting can only make
 * use of already existing contextual data. That is, adding or replacing query text or reuse of bound parameters. Query
 * rewriting must not add additional bindable parameters as these cannot be materialized.
