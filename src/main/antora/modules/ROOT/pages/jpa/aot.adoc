= Ahead of Time Optimizations

This chapter covers Spring Data's Ahead of Time (AOT) optimizations that build upon {spring-framework-docs}/core/aot.html[Spring's Ahead of Time Optimizations].

== Best Practices

=== Annotate your Domain Types

During application startup, Spring scans the classpath for domain classes for early processing of entities.
By annotating your domain types with Spring Data-specific `@Table`, `@Document` or `@Entity` annotations you can aid initial entity scanning and ensure that those types are registered with `ManagedTypes` for Runtime Hints.
Classpath scanning is not possible in native image arrangements and so Spring has to use `ManagedTypes` for the initial entity set.

[[aot.hints]]
== Runtime Hints

Running an application as a native image requires additional information compared to a regular JVM runtime.
Spring Data contributes {spring-framework-docs}/core/aot.html#aot.hints[Runtime Hints] during AOT processing for native image usage.
These are in particular hints for:

* Auditing
* `ManagedTypes` to capture the outcome of class-path scans
* Repositories
** Reflection hints for entities, return types, and Spring Data annotations
** Repository fragments
** Querydsl `Q` classes
** Kotlin Coroutine support
* Web support (Jackson Hints for `PagedModel`)

[[aot.repositories]]
== Ahead of Time Repositories

AOT Repositories are an extension to AOT processing by pre-generating eligible query method implementations.
Query methods are opaque to developers regarding their underlying queries being executed in a query method call.
AOT repositories contribute query method implementations based on derived, annotated, and named queries that are known at build-time.
This optimization moves query method processing from runtime to build-time, which can lead to a significant performance improvement as query methods do not need to be analyzed reflectively upon each application start.

The resulting AOT repository fragment follows the naming scheme of `<Repository FQCN>Impl__Aot` and is placed in the same package as the repository interface.
You can find all queries in their String form for generated repository query methods.

NOTE: Consider AOT repository classes an internal optimization.
Do not use them directly in your code as generation and implementation details may change in future releases.

=== Running with AOT Repositories

AOT is a mandatory step to transform a Spring application to a native executable, so it is automatically enabled when running in this mode.
When AOT is enabled (either for native compilation or by setting `spring.aot.enabled=true`), AOT repositories are automatically enabled by default.

You can explicitly control AOT repository generation by setting the `spring.aot.repositories.enabled` property:

* `spring.aot.repositories.enabled=true` - Explicitly enable AOT repositories
* `spring.aot.repositories.enabled=false` - Disable AOT repositories even when AOT is enabled

AOT repositories contribute configuration changes to the actual repository bean registration to register the generated repository fragment.

NOTE: When AOT optimizations are included, some decisions that have been taken at build-time are hard-coded in the application setup.
For instance, profiles that have been enabled at build-time are automatically enabled at runtime as well.
Also, the Spring Data module implementing a repository is fixed.
Changing the implementation requires AOT re-processing.

NOTE: AOT processing avoids database access.
Therefore, it initializes an in-memory Hibernate instance for metadata collection.
Types for the Hibernate configuration are determined by our AOT metadata collector.
We prefer using a `PersistentEntityTypes` bean if available and fall back to `PersistenceUnitInfo` or our own discovered types.
If our type scanning is not sufficient for your arrangement, you can enable direct `EntityManagerFactory` usage by configuring the `spring.aot.jpa.repositories.use-entitymanager=true` property.

=== Eligible Methods

AOT repositories filter methods that are eligible for AOT processing.
These are typically all query methods that are not backed by an xref:repositories/custom-implementations.adoc[implementation fragment].

**Supported Features**

* Derived query methods, `@Query`/`@NativeQuery` and named query methods
* `@Modifying` methods returning `void` or `int`
* `@QueryHints` support
* Pagination, `Slice`, `Stream`, and `Optional` return types
* Sort query rewriting
* DTO Projections
* Value Expressions (Those require a bit of reflective information.
Mind that using Value Expressions requires expression parsing and contextual information to evaluate the expression)

**Limitations**

* Requires Hibernate for AOT processing.
* Configuration of `escapeCharacter` and `queryEnhancerSelector` are not yet considered
* `QueryRewriter` must be a no-args class. `QueryRewriter` beans are not yet supported.
* Methods accepting `ScrollPosition` (e.g. `Keyset` pagination) are not yet supported

**Excluded methods**

* `CrudRepository`, Querydsl, Query by Example, and other base interface methods as their implementation is provided by the base class respective fragments
* Methods whose implementation would be overly complex
** Methods accepting `ScrollPosition` (e.g. `Keyset` pagination)
** Stored procedure query methods annotated with `@Procedure`
** Dynamic projections

[[aot.repositories.json]]
== Repository Metadata

AOT processing introspects query methods and collects metadata about repository queries.
Spring Data JPA stores this metadata in JSON files that are named like the repository interface and stored next to it (i.e. within the same package).
Repository JSON Metadata contains details about queries and fragments.
An example for the following repository is shown below:

====
[source,java]
----
interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Integer> {

  List<User> findUserNoArgumentsBy();                                                  <1>

  Page<User> findPageOfUsersByLastnameStartingWith(String lastname, Pageable page);    <2>

  @Query("select u from User u where u.emailAddress = ?1")
  User findAnnotatedQueryByEmailAddress(String username);                              <3>

  User findByEmailAddress(String emailAddress);                                        <4>

  @Procedure(value = "sp_add")
  Integer providedProcedure(@Param("arg") Integer arg);                                <5>
}
----

<1> Derived query without arguments.
<2> Derived query using pagination.
<3> Annotated query.
<4> Named query.
<5> Stored procedure with a provided procedure name.
While stored procedure methods are included in JSON metadata, their method code blocks are not generated in AOT repositories.

Queries may contain the following fields:

* `query`: Query descriptor if the method is a query method.
** `name`: Name of the named query if the query is a named one.
** `query` the query used to obtain the query method result from `EntityManager`
** `count-name`: Name of the named count query if the count query is a named one.
** `count-query`: The count query used to obtain the count for query methods using pagination.
** `procedure-name`: Name of the named stored procedure if the stored procedure is a named one.
** `procedure`: Stored procedure name if the query method uses stored procedures.
* `fragment`: Target fragment if the method call is delegated to a store (repository base class, functional fragment such as Querydsl) or user fragment.
Fragments are either described with just `fragment` if there is no further interface or as `interface` and `fragment` tuple in case there is an interface (such as Querydsl or user-declared fragment interface).

[NOTE]
.Normalized Query Form
====
Static analysis of queries allows only a limited representation of runtime query behavior.
Queries are represented in their normalized (pre-parsed and rewritten) form:

* Value Expressions are replaced with bind markers.
* Queries follow the specified query language (JPQL or native) and do not represent the final SQL query.
Spring Data cannot derive the final SQL queries as this is database-specific and depends on the actual runtime environment and parameters (e.g. Entity Graphs, Lazy Loading).
* Query Metadata does not reflect bind-value processing.
`StartingWith`/`EndingWith` queries prepend/append the wildcard character `%` to the actual bind value.
* Runtime Sort information cannot be incorporated in the query string itself as that detail is not known at build-time.
