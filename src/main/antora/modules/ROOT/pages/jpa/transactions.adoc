[[transactions]]
= Transactionality

By default, methods inherited from `CrudRepository` inherit the transactional configuration from javadoc:org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.support.SimpleJpaRepository[].
For read operations, the transaction configuration `readOnly` flag is set to `true`.
All others are configured with a plain `@Transactional` so that default transaction configuration applies.
Repository methods that are backed by transactional repository fragments inherit the transactional attributes from the actual fragment method.

If you need to tweak transaction configuration for one of the methods declared in a repository, redeclare the method in your repository interface, as follows:

.Custom transaction configuration for CRUD
====
[source, java]
----
public interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository<User, Long> {

  @Override
  @Transactional(timeout = 10)
  public List<User> findAll();

  // Further query method declarations
}
----
Doing so causes the `findAll()` method to run with a timeout of 10 seconds and without the `readOnly` flag.
====

Another way to alter transactional behaviour is to use a facade or service implementation that (typically) covers more than one repository. Its purpose is to define transactional boundaries for non-CRUD operations. The following example shows how to use such a facade for more than one repository:

.Using a facade to define transactions for multiple repository calls
====
[source, java]
----
@Service
public class UserManagementImpl implements UserManagement {

  private final UserRepository userRepository;
  private final RoleRepository roleRepository;

  public UserManagementImpl(UserRepository userRepository,
    RoleRepository roleRepository) {
    this.userRepository = userRepository;
    this.roleRepository = roleRepository;
  }

  @Transactional
  public void addRoleToAllUsers(String roleName) {

    Role role = roleRepository.findByName(roleName);

    for (User user : userRepository.findAll()) {
      user.addRole(role);
      userRepository.save(user);
    }
  }
}
----
This example causes call to `addRoleToAllUsers(â€¦)` to run inside a transaction (participating in an existing one or creating a new one if none are already running). The transaction configuration at the repositories is then neglected, as the outer transaction configuration determines the actual one used. Note that you must activate `<tx:annotation-driven />` or use `@EnableTransactionManagement` explicitly to get annotation-based configuration of facades to work.
This example assumes you use component scanning.

Note that the call to `save` is not strictly necessary from a JPA point of view, but should still be there in order to stay consistent to the repository abstraction offered by Spring Data.
====

[[transactional-query-methods]]
== Transactional query methods

Declared query methods (including default methods) do not get any transaction configuration applied by default.
To run those methods transactionally, use `@Transactional` at the repository interface you define, as shown in the following example:

.Using @Transactional at query methods
====
[source, java]
----
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {

  List<User> findByLastname(String lastname);

  @Modifying
  @Transactional
  @Query("delete from User u where u.active = false")
  void deleteInactiveUsers();
}
----
Typically, you want the `readOnly` flag to be set to `true`, as most of the query methods only read data. In contrast to that, `deleteInactiveUsers()` makes use of the `@Modifying` annotation and overrides the transaction configuration. Thus, the method runs with the `readOnly` flag set to `false`.
====

[NOTE]
====
You can use transactions for read-only queries and mark them as such by setting the `readOnly` flag. Doing so does not, however, act as a check that you do not trigger a manipulating query (although some databases reject `INSERT` and `UPDATE` statements inside a read-only transaction). The `readOnly` flag is instead propagated as a hint to the underlying JDBC driver for performance optimizations. Furthermore, Spring performs some optimizations on the underlying JPA provider. For example, when used with Hibernate, the flush mode is set to `NEVER` when you configure a transaction as `readOnly`, which causes Hibernate to skip dirty checks (a noticeable improvement on large object trees).
====

[NOTE]
====
While this example shows `@Transactional` on the repository interface, we generally recommend defining transaction boundaries at the service layer to reflect business logic units and ensure consistency.
